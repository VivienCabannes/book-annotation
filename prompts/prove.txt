### Goal

I am trying to prove the statement in this file by replacing all occurrences of `sorry` with complete proofs.
A proof will be considered correct if running

```bash
lake build
```

completes without any errors or warnings.

### Dependencies

These proofs can be built using **mathlib**, available in `.lake/packages/mathlib`.
You may also use any other packages found in `.lake/package`.

You are free to use additional resources from the internet.
If you do so, make sure to add the corresponding dependencies to `lake-manifest.json`, and then run:

```bash
lake exe cache get
```

to update the dependencies.

### Informal Proofs

The theorems to be proven correspond to the formal statements from the book *Convex Optimization: Algorithms and Complexity*.
The LaTeX source files for the book are located in `books/bubeck_convex_optimization`.
You can browse these files to find the informal proofs, which should guide your formalizations.

Use the format theorem, sorry, proposition, sorry.

Add a comment with the number of the theorems
